## Project for testing out Fabric API for Minecraft Mod coding

A simple mod made to test the [Fabric API](https://fabricmc.net/develop/) and learning [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).\
Right now the mod only adds a few 3 new items, the corresponding tools and armor, and 3 new blocks to the game.\
The items all have crafting recipes. I'm working on also adding a new mob, a snake.
